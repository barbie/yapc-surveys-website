<h2>The Perl Community, YAPCs &amp; Workshops</h2>

</table>

<h4>If 'No', could you tell us why?</h4>

<p>Particularly if this is your first YAPC, we would like to understand why you would not be able or interested in attend another event like it.</p>

<ul>
<li>For some reason the (London) Workshops always clash with a previous engagement. I plan to attend one day, when it doesn't :)</li>
<li>I was there as a sponser and participating at the jobfair. I'm not an IT guy, so the workshops are not for me.</li>
<li>I would like to participate again, but most likely I would have to travel abroad and have my employer fund the trip.</li>
<li>Let me answer on behalf of 5 persons I know who came to a Perl YAPC/Workshop, never to return again in such a conference.
    They were all Perl users. They all found that these conferences are, to a large extent, more for people working *on* Perl, rather than people working *with* Perl.
    The shock was such, that they simply didn't come back.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Are you a member of a local Perl Mongers user group?</h3>

<h3>Are there any topics you would specifically like to see featured?</h3>

<ul>
<li>- localisation and internationalisation<br />
    - high performance computing<br />
    - security<br />
    - fast string matching<br />
    - advanced regular expressions</li>
<li>A beginner's track<br />
    More serious talks</li>
<li>A session for &quot;Rookie Lightning Talks&quot; and possible a 45 minute block with several 10 minute talks for first time speakers.  Need a real beginner track, including the usual topics like how to build a module for CPAN.  The speakers can change every year, but these simple topics should endure as they can be very important at the right point in a programmers life.</li>
<li>Although I prefer expert level talks, I'd really like to see a beginner level track - not for me, I'll probably attend no matter which talks, but for attracting perl &quot;novices&quot; who feel scared to go at the moment.</li>
<li>Beginners Track is a good idea, but as many attendees are experts it would be also nice to learn about teaching perl<br />
    Best/Worst Practices<br />
    Making CPAN modules - as there are now several ways to build one and META.yml is still developing, module-beginners need help with that</li>
<li>Corporate Perl for next years YAPC::Europe sounds interesting.</li>
<li>Distributed programming with perl tools</li>
<li>Examples of big, real life applications composed from &quot;mainstream&quot; components (Catalyst, DBIx::Class, ...) - architectural decisions, naming conventions, ..</li>
<li>Generating code during runtime. Emulating macros. Opcode hacking.</li>
<li>I would like to see more experts making intermediate/expert level talks, rather than fun talks.</li>
<li>I would prefer more in-depth talks instead of beginner talks - or in addition to!</li>
<li>Interfacing with other programming languages.</li>
<li>Introductions to other programming languages, from a Perl point of view.</li>
<li>Mapping/Geospatial related?</li>
<li>Mashups</li>
<li>More advanced Web topics</li>
<li>More functional programming</li>
<li>more success stories, and less perl syntax talks</li>
<li>More talks about testing</li>
<li>MULDIS D</li>
<li>Natural Language Processing, PDL</li>
<li>None that spring to mind - a wide range of ideas usually get covered.
    Maybe a longer Ovid-testing presentation?</li>
<li>OO - What are objects, classes, prototypes and how to use them</li>
<li>Open Source Community Management</li>
<li>Parellelization<br />
    Computing clouds and clustering</li>
<li>Perl use in system administration<br />
    (I hope forthcoming YAPC in Lisbon, as being dubbed &quot;Corporate Perl&quot;, may cover some of this),<br />
    in the same vein, Perl use for Monitoring (like by Nagios/Munin, SNMP etc. plug-ins),<br />
    Perl use in Engineering (does anyone do this at all? because I haven't found any modules on CPAN and once proposed to Adam Kennedy a name space like Eng or so)<br />
    Perl use in Numerical Analysis (again, does anyone do this? probably number crunching requires compiled code anyway?)<br />
    Perl use for (engineering, physics) Data Analysis,<br />
    as well as for visualization (e.g. interpolation, approximation, curve fitting, line fairing, SVG)<br />
    Perl for Webapps (I'm fed up of all the RAILs, J2EE, PHP Hype in this area and Perl has completely disappeared from the radar of web developers, and if still known is looked down at very condescendingly, thought of as not a proper programming language)</li>
<li>perlguts, non-trivial xs, crazy things like Devel::Declare</li>
<li>POE<br />
    more on databases, rather than introductions to DBIx and such</li>
<li>Practical approaches to:<br />
    1. mod_parrot configuration and optimization<br />
    2. mod_parrot/rakudo memory analysis and optimization<br />
    3. mod_parrot/rakudo best practices<br />
    4. conformity in the community about recommended standard approaches (patterns/best practices), and leaving going timtowdi, for those who have a special need only.<br />
    5. enterprise standards for perl<br />
    6. marketing perl, clean up perls appearance to the world</li>
<li>Scalability and high volume web sites</li>
<li>svn vs git, applications</li>
<li>System Admin tracks</li>
<li>templates - current alternatives + future directions<br />
    web frameworks - ditto</li>
<li>The announced topic &quot;Corporate Perl&quot; of the next YAPC will be very interesting!</li>
<li>The topics featured were very interesting, it was a right mix of things. Hope to see more of such diversity next year.</li>
<li>unusual use of perl (bioligy, simulations, AI ..)</li>
<li>Using Catalyst or Jifty, OO design, more focus on practical stuff rather than theoretical/structural stuff</li>
<li>XS</li>
</ul>

<div id="commentBlock">
<ul>
<li>&quot;Value for price&quot; is a relative concept in Copenhagen - everything's so expensive, but that's got nothing to do with YAPC::Europe. I had a good time and plan to attend the next one as well.</li>
<li>(I was a speaker, so didn't pay for the conference, but the value/price of Copenhagen in general is not great.)</li>
<li>- The web site lacks too much for a conference that pretend to be professional.<br />
    - The conference fee (individual rate) was too high.</li>
<li>1) I think that 30 min per talk is not enough. Most talks were very light without going deep into the matter at hand.<br />
    2) Copenhagen was very expensive.</li>
<li>1. it was excellent that there was sponsored lunch - not only it saved time, but also helped to socialize - almost everyone eating together</li>
<li>A diner for 300 people could have more variance, more to choose from.</li>
<li>About the website: why did you write the dates in MM/DD/YY format? Dates in this format are difficult for the majority of YAPC::EU's attendees, who are more used to DD/MM/YY or DD/MM/YYYY  dates. And the best format, of course, is YYYY-MM-DD (with a 4-digit year), which everyone understand, even the few people from across the Atlantic. Another possibility would be to use the month's full English name.</li>
<li>Again, no printed proceedings available.<br /> 
    web site: I missed detailed info how to go to the venue<br />
    talks: I want talk alternatives when Larry Walk is talking (no keynote)</li>
<li>Altogether: a very pleasant experience.</li>
<li>As a vegetarian I had a though time finding something acceptable to eat (the university staff helped out a lot). Please think of us next time (I fear Lissabon is even more carnivore-oriented as Copenhagen).</li>
<li>As a vegeterian, I disliked the lunched utterly: sandwich with cucumber, with tomato, with lettuce, with shrimps (WTF?). Not tasty. Vegetarians can eat cheese, egg and many sorts of sauces. The attendees dinner had nothing special for vegetarians (yeah, vegetables and potatoes, wow, I'm so honoured).<br />
    Power outlets!!!  So many people could not use their notebook because of the lack of sufficient numbers of power outlets.<br />
    Good bag: there wasn't one. Pity.<br />
    Schedule: everything was 30 minutes. Speakers could hardly go deep into their subject.  Next time please also 45 and / or 60 minute items.<br />
    Directions: it was not clear where the venue was (the entrances to the building, what building exactly).<br />
    Schedule: maybe next year a beginner's track? And some rooms extra for hackathons, BOFs and other meetings.<br />
    Ravelinen: just Carlberg's beer was no fun. Those idiots had Leffe on tap and refused to sell it to us, it was just for the &quot;real clients&quot; inside the restaurant. Morons, that's what they are.</li>
<li>At launch the website was just a default ACT install - no design or stylesheet was applied. This unfortunately does not portray a good image of YAPC, especially when compared to Perl's competitors. Now of course I realise that the majority of programmers are not designers, but if the organisers do not have these skills then asking for help on use.perl.org or the conferences mailing list may have helped. See http://conferences.yapcasia.org/ya2008/ for an example of what can be done with ACT.<br />
    The food service was fantastic - such a good idea to provide catering on-site. This meant that people were not disappearing to the pub etc and so ensured that the afternoon talks started on time with no latecomers. I would love to see this repeated at future YAPCs.</li>
<li>Don't put so much stress on beer.</li>
<li>food service was not good for vegetarians. I was lucky as I do eat fish and could find food by looking through the bags but I know several vegans had a hard tome and even I had to pick the bits of meat out of the salad.<br />
    hotels: Copenhagen is an expensive city, not you guys' fault ;-)<br />
    I had a problem with the venue change for the tutorials after the conf. Did not get the email that brian foy said had been sent out on Friday. I really think that when a change like that is made at short notice you should have made certain that the registered attendees were aware, probably by announcing it in the conference platform. Just updating the News page on the wiki was not enough - there were guys on both days who were inconvenienced because they just did not [or were unable to] look at that page. That's the only reason for my 'staff' rating above; other than that I thought that you guys were great ;-)<br />
    But my overall impression of the week was good enough to override these gripes.</li>
<li>For Speakers: It would be great to have an extra screen to watch for those whose notebooks can only show ouput either at their TFT or the external output. (No, i won't switch to windows =)</li>
<li>I did not have any idea of what to expect from the conference, and I would not have taken it if it weren't in the Copenhagen area. I must admit, I was very pleasantly surprised at the quality and overall atmosphere :)</li>
<li>I especially liked the free lunch bags. :)</li>
<li>I feel the conference lacked enough communication during the year.<br />
    Also, registration opened way too late.<br />
    I also felt the absence of selected hotels by the organizers so that most people could be together at an affordable place.</li>
<li>i found 30 mins was a little short for the talks, a lot of the time the speakers had to rush to finish everything they wanted to cover. perhaps 10 or 15 mins longer would have helped.</li>
<li>I really liked the fact there was a 10 minute break after each talk, and that all the talks were of the same length. This greatly reduced the number of people moving around during the talk. OTOH, having only one length of slot available made it harder for speakers to prepare. Sometimes, you need at least 45 minutes, or it turns out that 20 minutes is enough.<br />
    I scored the 'social events' very negatively, due to the really poor auction this year. I will come back to that in a separate email - this text box is too small to list all the grieves.</li>
<li>I was quite irritated by the silly games, both at the dinner and before the auction, to give away a few trinkets. It felt like being held hostage by an annoying salesman. Time at a conference like YAPC is extremely precious, so wasting it is really a shame.This is definitely not what I came to YAPC for.<br />
    I realize that it is quite difficult for the organizers to deal with that kind of problem though.</li>
<li>I would have liked some conventions with hotels, like they did in Vienna (and Copenhagen is more expensive than Vienna). Moreover, I think that directions could have been better in the web site: putting a map without some clear indications of where to take the Metro, where to go, etc. makes all the attendant do the same work by their own. And no, the wiki's no help here, because all of us did it at the very end :D</li>
<li>I would have liked the key talks to have been held during the day - not in the morning were I was unable to attend.</li>
<li>Internet access was poor.<br />
    Wanted to buy stuff in the auction, but it took too long and I lost interest and left even before it actually got started.</li>
<li>It sucks that year-after-year attendees continue to have chronic wireless problems, either no network ar a terribly overloaded network.<br />
    I realize that this isn't a very solvable problem since the network comes with the venue and setting up custom network hardware would be expensive, but still.</li>
<li>Make it easy for companies to pay for several attendees.<br />
    Put a level on the talks to give a heads up - specially about beginner stuff.</li>
<li>No, I won't mention the wireless net. Promise.</li>
<li>No, thank you.</li>
<li>not just 30 min talks.<br />
    no lightning talks from regular speakers (you know who you are)<br />
    auction way way to long</li>
<li>On the webbsite, the location and map links in the navigation to the left should be merged.</li>
<li>Overall an excellent conference.</li>
<li>Parking in CPH was somewhat complicated, but that's my own responsibility, being aware that the conf was in a major city. Hotels w/parking are rare, it seems. But it wasn't a big problem. YAPC was excellent.</li>
<li>Parking was excellent! Never had trouble find a space, and all for free! However, there was absolutely no parking information available on the webpage, which is essential information for local attendees.<br />
    Registration was impressively efficient. Even though I registered the day before the conference after bank hours, the process was registered correctly, and a badge was ready and printed.<br />
    Having just attended the $2,000 OSCON, a registration fee of 900DKK including lunch &amp; dinner is impressive value for money. Keep it up!</li>
<li>Please make a reliable and sufficient WiFi available. In these times, more and more talks will depend on available access.</li>
<li>Price for conference was ok.<br />
    Price for hotels was amazingly high.<br />
    Website was cluttered and confused.<br />
    Not enough time for BOFs to be truly effective.</li>
<li>Quite good conference, except for the wireless coverage and the lack of a printed programme.<br />
    Some talks were very good, others a waste of time. Some speakers don't have anything to say or don't know how to present it (e.g. reading slides or white text on red background on a blurry projector).</li>
<li>Showing pictures of the hotel rooms and facilities would be of great help.</li>
<li>Social event needed a microphone or other way of greatly amplifying the signal-to-noise ratio of the french guy making competitions for gifts.</li>
<li>Some of the salads sucked!</li>
<li>The &quot;perl culture&quot; bits of the conference w/o any technical content get tiresome quickly.</li>
<li>The auction has been terrible. Too slow and boring. All those books and silly stuff should really be out of the auction.</li>
<li>The auction needs to be rethought. it was long and there was a lot of boring content.</li>
<li>The auction went very wrong. Undressing contests, totally boring BooK's ugly T-shirts sale and the whole length of the event. Please, bring Greg McCarroll next time to be the auctioneer :)</li>
<li>The biggest problem with the venue was lack of power points, for people with laptops.  The assumption was that they would exist, so a lot of people never managed to take notes.</li>
<li>The BOFs were mostly ignored from the schedule, and no opportunity was made to make them more visible for new attendees.<br />
    No easily accessible venue map, and the 2.07 (?) rooms were too far away from the main rooms.</li>
<li>The conference signs weren't too perceptive - they should have been bigger or more often placed. The wireless network left something to be desired.</li>
<li>The number of Perl conferences is increasing, and this is great!<br />
    Perhaps now is the correct timing to expand: in addition to the current YAPC::Europe conferences (which in my opinion should not change), should there not be a separate &quot;Corporate&quot; Perl conference, specifically designed for Perl users ? I mean, IT professionals who just use Perl for their job ?</li>
<li>The organization of the conference seemed to be very smooth. I know it can't have been because it never is, but as far as I know, not a single glitch made it through to the attendees. The organizers did a great job!</li>
<li>The organization seemed less focused then in Vienna, and it relied on people checking the website instead of sending out more stuff by email.</li>
<li>The wifi was a bit flaky.</li>
<li>The wifi was too weak.</li>
<li>The WIFI..............(non-existent)</li>
<li>There should be two or three hotels that hold the majority of participants to facilitate the Fluxx track.  This year we were split all over town.  The bofs were almost non existent this year.  We really need the organizers to provide several time slots and locations that bof organizers can choose from.
    Copenhagen is too expensive.</li>
<li>there was a big problem with WiFi, which is a shame, as limited CPAN contributions during the conference.</li>
<li>there were no vegetarian food.</li>
<li>Vegetarian options should be asked upfront on registration and not made the responsibility of the attendee.</li>
<li>very poor WLAN at Copenhagen Business School, otherwise excellent venue...</li>
<li>Very well run and organised.<br />
    Vegetarian food options were sadly limited.<br />
    It was harder to meet up and socialise than at YAPC::EU Wien, maybe because hotels were spread out. Also seemed to be little activity on the Wiki?</li>
<li>Weak WiFi.</li>
<li>Web site: I would have wanted more detailed journey plan.<br />
    Overall experience: the danish girls look beautifyl. :-)</li>
<li>When you get a bunch of perl hackers in one place, the network will be severely strained. :) Wifi and wireless services need to have greater capacity that was available at CBS.</li>
<li>YAPC::EU is going from strength to strength</li>
<li>Yes. Where was the vegetarian lunch?</li>
<li>You did a great job!</li>
<li>You don't do an &quot;economy&quot; conference in a city or even country with prices like Copenhagen, sorry. 150-200 Euro/night in a decent hotel for a double bedroom?! The low registration price suddenly doesn't mean so much.</li>
